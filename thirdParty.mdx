# Technology Stack Rationale

## Frontend Framework - React

**Technology**: React.js  
**Rationale**: We chose React for our web application frontend because it allows us to create a highly performant application with excellent user experience. Additionally, React provides the foundation for future mobile app development using React Native, enabling us to share code and development expertise across web and mobile platforms. This approach maximizes our development efficiency and ensures consistency across all user interfaces.

## Email Service - Gmail API

**Technology**: Gmail API Service  
**Rationale**: We integrated Gmail's email API service for our driver notifications and marketing email campaigns. Gmail API was selected due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. The straightforward integration process allows us to quickly send automated notifications to drivers when they are approved by admins, as well as manage our marketing email communications efficiently. The reliability and widespread adoption of Gmail ensures high deliverability rates for our communications.

## Testing Frameworks

**Technologies**: Jest (Frontend) and Pytest (Backend)  
**Rationale**: 
- **Jest**: Selected for frontend testing because our development team has extensive experience with Jest, allowing us to implement comprehensive testing quickly and effectively.
- **Pytest**: Chosen for backend testing due to its simplicity and ease of learning. The straightforward syntax and powerful features make it accessible for our team to write and maintain robust test suites for our API endpoints.

## Backend Framework - FastAPI

**Technology**: FastAPI  
**Rationale**: We selected FastAPI for our backend API development because our team has significant experience with this framework, enabling rapid development and deployment. Additionally, FastAPI's architecture and performance characteristics make it ideal for future scaling using Kubernetes. The framework's built-in support for async operations, automatic API documentation generation, and excellent performance make it well-suited for handling the demands of a food delivery platform that may need to scale horizontally in the future.

```json
{
    "detail": "Could not validate credentials + [provided_api_key]"
}
```
