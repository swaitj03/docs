<Card title="Github Flow Methodology">
Main branch is always a depolyable version. Features are branched from main and not other branches. This is an effective methodology for fast-paced development environments with numerous developers working on the same product.

<Card title="How to use our Github">
1. Branch off main to develop a feature <br/>
2. Develop the feature <br/>
3. Check that all the tests pass and the app still functions <br/>
4. Open a PR to merge your branch into main and request Calvin review the changes <br/>
5. Calvin merges the branch if it looks good, otherwise Calvin closes the PR and you try again <br/>
