# Audit and Response to S1ngularity/nx Attacks

## Nx Attack

### Cause of the attack:
The cause of the Nx attack was due to a phishing email sent to Josh Junon, a maintainer of the exposed npm packages. The email sent was disguised as the npm support team requesting an update to their 2-factor authentication. After clicking on the link and entering his credentials, the attackers were able to gain access to his account and modify his npm packages. Thus, making this single point of human error the root cause of this attack.

### Report on exposed packages:
Fortunately, we have no exposed npm packages installed whatsoever. As a result, no immediate action is needed.

## Measures that can be put in place to prevent malicious attacks in the future:

1. Always committing a package-lock.json to version control ensures that builds always install the exact, non-malicious versions of packages, rather than pulling in potentially compromised packages.
2. Run npm audit regularly to catch known vulnerabilities
3. Minimise the use of dependencies since every dependency is a potential risk. Thus, avoid the unnecessary installation of dependencies as well as removing unused dependencies

## Measures that can be put in place to avoid your product being infected:

1. Restrict or disable the ability for scripts to be run through npm using "npm install --ignore-scripts" This helps prevent several attack methods
2. Run builds/tests in isolated CI containers to reduce infection of your repository if a package is compromised
3. Use a private npm proxy such as GitHub Packages so you can cache safe versions of packages and avoid pulling directly from the npm public every time
