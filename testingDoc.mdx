Outlines the overall testing strategy, scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and entry/exit criteria for a testing effort.
Test Scenarios:
Describe end-to-end user flows or specific functionalities to be tested, often comprising multiple test cases.
Test Cases:
Detailed instructions for performing a specific test, including preconditions, steps, inputs, expected outcomes, and post-conditions.
Traceability Matrix:
Links requirements to test cases, and potentially to defects, ensuring that all requirements are covered by testing and that defects are traced back to their source.
Test Reports:
Summarize the results of test execution, including pass/fail rates, defect metrics, and overall test coverage.
Bug Reports/Defect Reports:
Document identified defects, including steps to reproduce, actual results, expected results, severity, and priority.
Test Logs:
Detailed records of test execution, including timestamps, actions taken, and observations.
Purpose and Benefits:
Improved Communication:
Facilitates clear communication among developers, testers, stakeholders, and clients regarding testing scope, objectives, and progress.
Systematic Approach:
Ensures testing is conducted systematically and consistently, following defined procedures and standards.
Traceability and Accountability:
Provides a clear audit trail from requirements to test cases and defects, enabling accountability and tracking of progress.
Knowledge Transfer:
Serves as a valuable resource for future reference, onboarding new team members, and maintaining consistency across releases.
Quality Assurance:
Contributes to higher quality software by ensuring thorough testing and effective defect management.
Cost and Time Efficiency:
Reduces rework and delays by identifying issues early and providing clear guidance for testing activities.
