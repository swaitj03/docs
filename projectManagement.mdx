### Sprint 1 Planning

Calvin: <br/>
Repo & Project Board Setup <br/>
FastAPI Template, PR reviews, Development tasks creation <br/>
Linting/Formatting workflows, Vercel/Render deployments <br/>

Connor: <br/>
Admin home page to manage restaurants and menu items <br/>
Backend endpoints for restaurants and menu items <br/>

Jonothan: <br/>
Supabase project setup, authentication, and user management <br/>
Frontend: Login, signup, logout pages <br/>
Backend: User creation, token validation, role-based redirection <br/>

Aharon: <br/>
Buyer home page implementation <br/>
Display all restaurants and allow details view <br/>

Jade: <br/>
Development Guides <br/>
Git Methodology <br/>

Jacob:  <br/>
Improve Documentation

### Sprint Backlog Refinement

Calvin <br/>
Set up automated testing for FastAPI, ensure CI/CD pipelines are running smoothly. <br/>
Improve Standups: Work with the team to limit standups to 10-15 minutes with clear goals. <br/>
Documentation: Help with documentation, specifically for technical workflows and setup guides. <br/>

Connor <br/>
Admin Features: Complete testing for restaurant/menu CRUD functionality, work on error handling for backend endpoints. <br/>
Communication: Work with Zag to explicitly define who works on what part to avoid overlapping efforts. <br/>
Authentication Flow: Collaborate with Jonothan to find a way to bypass authentication during local dev for testing. <br/>

Jonothan <br/>
Frontend Expansion: Expand role-based redirects on frontend, testing full flow. <br/>
Backend: Create endpoints for updating and deleting user profiles. <br/>
Security: Review the security of the Supabase implementation and ensure there are no gaps in access control. <br/>

Aharon <br/>
Buyer Home Page: Add additional features (filter by category, search, etc.) <br/>
Integration: Work closely with Connor and Jonothan to ensure frontend integrates smoothly with backend. <br/>
Testing: Focus on ensuring the buyer experience is bug-free and seamless. <br/>

Jade <br/>
Clarify Docs: Reach out to the team for clear guidance on which parts of the documentation need more detail. <br/>
Finalize Documentation: Ensure thereâ€™s clear documentation on setup, environment variables, and API usage. <br/>

### Sprint Retrospective

Calvin: <br/>
Improvement: Focus on Daily Standups and reducing meeting time.

Connor: <br/>
Improvement: Clarify task boundaries to avoid overlap with Zag and streamline communication. Frustration with authentication flow.

Jonothan: <br/>
Improvements: Ensure robust communication and task breakdown to avoid confusion.

Aharon: <br/>
Improvement: Focus on clearer task communication and tech stack understanding.

Jade: <br/>
Improvement: Get a better understanding of all requirements

What to do better next time:
Task Refinement: Assign specific subtasks to avoid duplication of effort (e.g., admin CRUD, authentication flow).
Authentication Streamlining: Investigate solutions for testing without full authentication in place (perhaps a mock user system).
Documentation Improvements: Jade and Calvin will meet to align on documentation standards.
Testing and QA: Introduce more testing at the component level for both backend and frontend. Assign someone to focus on overall test coverage.
Daily Standup Focus
Quick Updates: Focus on progress, blockers, and priority tasks.
Clear Communication: Encourage team to share what they are working on to avoid overlap and miscommunication.
