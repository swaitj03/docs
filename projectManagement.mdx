### Sprint Backlog Refinement: 13 August

Calvin <br/>
Set up automated testing for FastAPI, ensure CI/CD pipelines are running smoothly. <br/>
Improve Standups: Work with the team to limit standups to 10-15 minutes with clear goals. <br/>
Documentation: Help with documentation, specifically for technical workflows and setup guides. <br/>

Connor <br/>
Admin Features: Complete testing for restaurant/menu CRUD functionality, work on error handling for backend endpoints. <br/>
Communication: Work with Zag to explicitly define who works on what part to avoid overlapping efforts. <br/>
Authentication Flow: Collaborate with Jonothan to find a way to bypass authentication during local dev for testing. <br/>

Jonothan <br/>
Frontend Expansion: Expand role-based redirects on frontend, testing full flow. <br/>
Backend: Create endpoints for updating and deleting user profiles. <br/>
Security: Review the security of the Supabase implementation and ensure there are no gaps in access control. <br/>

Aharon <br/>
Buyer Home Page: Add additional features (filter by category, search, etc.) <br/>
Integration: Work closely with Connor and Jonothan to ensure frontend integrates smoothly with backend. <br/>
Testing: Focus on ensuring the buyer experience is bug-free and seamless. <br/>

Jade <br/>
Clarify Docs: Reach out to the team for clear guidance on which parts of the documentation need more detail. <br/>
Finalize Documentation: Ensure thereâ€™s clear documentation on setup, environment variables, and API usage. <br/>

### Sprint Retrospective: 18 August

Calvin: <br/>
Improvement: Focus on Daily Standups and reducing meeting time.

Connor: <br/>
Improvement: Clarify task boundaries to avoid overlap with Zag and streamline communication. Frustration with authentication flow.

Jonothan: <br/>
Improvements: Ensure robust communication and task breakdown to avoid confusion.

Aharon: <br/>
Improvement: Focus on clearer task communication and tech stack understanding.

Jade: <br/>
Improvement: Get a better understanding of all requirements

What to do better next time:
Task Refinement: Assign specific subtasks to avoid duplication of effort (e.g., admin CRUD, authentication flow).
Authentication Streamlining: Investigate solutions for testing without full authentication in place (perhaps a mock user system).
Documentation Improvements: Jade and Calvin will meet to align on documentation standards.
Testing and QA: Introduce more testing at the component level for both backend and frontend. Assign someone to focus on overall test coverage.
Daily Standup Focus
Quick Updates: Focus on progress, blockers, and priority tasks.
Clear Communication: Encourage team to share what they are working on to avoid overlap and miscommunication.

### Sprint 2 Planning: 23 August

Jonothan: <br/>
Create automated test cases for geofencing and campus validation. <br/>
Enhance backend validation functions (e.g. for malformed locations). <br/>
Add support for campus polygon updates via admin interface.

Connor: <br/>
Add approval/rejection on the driver admin page. <br/>
Add filtering and search to the admin driver page. <br/>
Fix database cascading rules properly and add safety checks.

Jacob: <br/>
Finalize and test complete checkout flow with cart context. <br/> 
Add fallback for Geolocation API (e.g., manual address input). <br/>
Improve handling of edge cases (e.g., location drifting).

Aharon: <br/>
Add cart quantity update functionality (not just add/remove). <br/>
Implement optimistic UI updates for cart actions. <br/>
Refactor cart API to ensure cleaner database operations. <br/>

Jade: <br/>
Split documentation into per-feature modules. <br/>
Add screenshots or screen-recordings to docs where relevant. <br/>
Begin creating a short onboarding doc for new devs/testers. <br/>

### Backlog Refinement: 30 August

Jonothan: <br/>
Security and Validation: Review and expand the validate_location function for edge cases. Ensure row-level security (RLS) is consistent and audited. <br/>
Campus Management: Enable tools or scripts to update campus polygons without manual geojson.io work. <br/>
Order Flow Enhancements: Add additional features to past/active orders (sorting, status updates). <br/>
Driver Flow Polish: Refine driver pages (Available, Current, Previous) for UX and performance improvements. 

Connor: <br/>
Admin Features: Finalize driver approvals admin page with complete backend coverage. Improve mobile responsiveness and add missing backend tests. <br/>
Backend Stability: Fix async issues across endpoints. <br/>
Ensure proper cascading deletes in DB schema for restaurants and related entities. 

Jacob: <br/>
Checkout Flow: Finalize the full cart â†’ checkout pipeline integration. Improve accuracy of user location data during checkout. <br/>
Geolocation & Geofencing: Extend geolocation handling to gracefully fail or notify if users are outside Wits campus. Ensure integration of geolocation with real-time UI feedback. <br/>
Order API Enhancements: Improve order placing flow for location accuracy and error handling. 

Aharon: <br/>
Cart Functionality: Add enhancements like quantity updates and better UI feedback on actions. Optimize cart deletion and syncing with backend. <br/>
Database Relationships: Continue working on normalizing tables and making sure relationships stay consistent when changes are made. <br/>
Testing: Improve reliability of the cart by adding more backend and frontend test coverage. 

Jade: <br/>
Documentation: Continue documenting the appâ€™s features and flows. Add more detail to technical documentation where needed. <br/>
Team Support: Ask teammates for brief summaries or notes on complex features to avoid delays in documentation. <br/>
Styling Polish: Add final touches and consistency to UI across pages.

### Sprint Retrospective: 1 September

Connor: <br/>
Improvement: Better deadline management such that tasks are not pushed to last minute.

Jade: <br/>
Improvement: Better co-ordination on documentation of features

Aharon: <br/>
Improvement: Deeper upfront understanding of table relationships

### What to do better next time: 

Task Refinement: Assign clear subtasks for complex areas (e.g., cart, admin, authentication) to prevent overlap or unclear ownership.
Deadline Management: Push for earlier internal deadlines to reduce last-minute development and testing.
Documentation Process: Encourage each developer to contribute initial docs or notes for features they build.
Cross-System Testing: Add end-to-end and unit tests to catch issues like table inconsistencies, location failures, or cart sync bugs.
Communication: Share progress earlier and more frequently across the team to reduce dependency blockers.
